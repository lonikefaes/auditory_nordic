# auditory_nordic

This repository accompanies a high-resolution 7T auditory dataset that is available on OPENNEURO. 
The data and code that can be found here are used for the following article (bioRxiv link to paper).

Note that the codes are written in Matlab and are poorly curated and rather specific for the data format we have used. We are working on better and more comprehensible versions of the code. 

Currently the input is data analyzed with BrainVoyager version 21.4 (Brain Inovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands).
